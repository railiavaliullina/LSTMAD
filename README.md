# LSTMAD

## About The Project

1) Implementation of LSTMAD architecture from `Long Short Term Memory Networks for Anomaly Detection in Time Series` paper:
                        https://www.researchgate.net/publication/
                        304782562_Long_Short_Term_Memory_Networks_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Time_Series

2) Training on ECG5000 Dataset.
